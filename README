What is SmartOptimizer?
-----------------------
SmartOptimizer is a php program that enhances your website performance using
techniques such as minifying, compression, caching, concatenation and embedding.
The idea is based on yahoo performace rules (http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html).


SmartOptimizer Features
-----------------------
* SmartOptimizer Increases your website download speed by reducing the size of JavaScript and
  CSS files approximately up to 80% or even higher.
* Reduces count of http requests by combining js/css files together.
* Also reduces count of http requests by embedding css images inside css files.
* SmartOptimizer generates minified, compressed, combined and embedded files on the
  first request and caches them on the server and uses the cache on future requests.
* It doesn't embed duplicated urls (i.e. css sprites) in css files for better performance.
* It also knows to regenerate already cached files if the originals have been changed.
* SmartOptimizer handles browsers that doesn't support gzip encoding and sends them non-gzipped content.
* It also forces the browser to cache the files optionally forever or until they have not changed.
* SmartOptimizer removes Etag headers. (for better performance on clustered servers).
* It is easy to install, since it requires no code modifications whatsoever. (other than .htaccess)
* All the features is configurable using config file.


Installation Requirements
-------------------------
* PHP 4.3.0 or higher.
* Apache with mod_rewrite enabled.
